  AI PR Reviewer (using Claude Code)
summary: |
  Automated PR code change review, powered by Claude Code.
description: |
  This step performs an AI-powered review of code changes in a pull request using Claude Code.

  It automatically:
  1. Installs Claude Code CLI
  2. Fetches and analyzes the diff between branches
  3. Generates a comprehensive code review using AI
  4. Optionally adds the review as annotations in the Bitrise UI
  5. Exposes the review as an output for other steps to use
